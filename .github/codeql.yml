# CodeQL Configuration for Advanced Security Analysis and Vulnerability Detection
# Enterprise-grade static security analysis complementing bandit scanning with GitHub's security intelligence
#
# Security Analysis Framework Components:
# - Advanced semantic code analysis with data flow tracking for Python/Flask applications
# - GitHub Security Intelligence integration for threat detection and vulnerability discovery
# - Flask-specific security pattern recognition and web application security validation
# - Automated security alert management with SARIF format reporting for GitHub Security tab
# - Integration with existing security scanning pipeline (bandit, safety, Trivy) for comprehensive coverage
# - Authentication and authorization code security review per Section 0.3.3 requirements
# - CI/CD pipeline integration for pull request validation per Section 6.6.2
#
# Compliance Coverage:
# - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability patterns with Flask framework specifics
# - SANS Top 25 software weakness detection and remediation guidance
# - CVE database integration for known vulnerability pattern matching
# - Enterprise security policy enforcement and automated compliance validation
# - Security finding integration with pull request review process
